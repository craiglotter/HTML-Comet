HTML Comet

All Commerce website course materials pages have a specific look and feel in terms of file downloads on the web. HTML Comet is a small application that sits on top of other forms and allows you to drop files onto it, in turn generating a web page for easy FrontPage copy and paste purposes.

(In addition, a small button at the bottom right of the form also generates a default Announcements page format.)
